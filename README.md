# LSA-DistilBERT-Model README

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for our thesis project titled "DEEP NLP AND DISTILBERT CONVERSATIONAL CHATBOT FOR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT". The project aims to improve the communication capability of a chatbot in understanding the subtleties and difficulties of the human language by using the Enhanced Transformer-Based model (DistilBERT) with the NLP-based chatbot machine for better performances in customer services applicable in the e-commerce business industries.

The user must have a personal computer or a laptop to install the Python 3 interpreter.
If you select “Install Now”:
- You will not need to be an administrator (unless a system update for the C Runtime Library is required or you install the Python Launcher for Windows for all users).
- Python will be installed into your user directory.
- The Python Launcher for Windows will be installed according to the option at the bottom of the first page.
- The standard library, test suite, launcher, and pip will be installed.
- If selected, the install directory will be added to your PATH.
- Shortcuts will only be visible to the current user.

Clone the repository.

## Requirements
To run the code and reproduce the results, you will need to download the prerequisite libraries used.
- [List of Libraries](https://github.com/KJSendrejas/LSA-DistilBERT-Model/blob/9223b5795561b476720d6eb43665730f53a72285/requires.txt)
- Open the terminal and use the command:
```pip install -r requires.txt```
This will reinstall all modules and also has the benefit of downloading the correct versions for the destination device hard/software.

## Run Application
